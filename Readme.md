## About
This repository will help you create a module for webtrees.
It is a basic, working module with no functionality.

Copy/clone to the directory you will develop your module and change those variables:
 * src/modulename to the modulename (lower case recommended)
 * src/modulename/module.php:<modulename> - each occurence of "modulename" with the module's name (lower case recommended).
 * The rest inside module.php as you desire.
